This provides a pure JavaScript code to dynamically move div in a circualar manner using absolute positioning and setInterval()

Here, we used the classical equation of circle to get the required coordinates of circle: 
For any circle of radius r with center C(rx, ry), the equation of coordinates of circle are: 
(x - rx) ** 2 + (y - ry) ** 2 = r ** 2

To make it visually vibrant, we used a little bit of basic CSS to give colors, path and outer and inner boundary to div.

It was purely done for having fun and educational purposes! Hope you will like it
